Only front end development are done pages so far.

All HTML pages are linked to their respective style sheets in the CSS folder.

Each page should be loaded individually as the login does not yet work.

# Pages created are:
  1. Create account
  2. Login
  3. My buckets page(is a sort of dashboard)
  4. Sample bucket list
  
They can all be viewed from the views file by using "/<name>"


Creting a new bucket for tody's task is done by adding:"/<newbucketname> to the bucketlist directory

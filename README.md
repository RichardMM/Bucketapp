# Bucketbook
The app allows user to create account, login create new buckets and add items to each bucket. Deleting items from a bucket list is still in development stages.

# Requirements:
1. Python 3.5 
2. Flask 0.12 and its dependencies
3. An internet browser. The app was tested on Microsoft edge

Each page should be loaded individually as the login does not yet work.

# Pages created are:
  1. Create account
  2. Login
  3. My buckets page(is a sort of dashboard) 
  4. Sample bucket list 
  
User can now create account, login and add new bucket
